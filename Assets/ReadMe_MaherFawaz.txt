  ___What trouble did you have with this project?___
The ladders in the WebGL build aren't functioning correctly. I was able to go down the first ladder by jumping and pressing down when my character got to the ladder but the issue has prevented me from getting to the end of the level. This issue was not present while I was running the game in the Unity Editor.


  ___Is there anything else we should know?___
